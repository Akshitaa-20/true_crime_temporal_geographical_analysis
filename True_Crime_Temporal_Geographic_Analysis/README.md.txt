# True Crime Temporal & Geographical Analysis

##Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world crime data from Chicago to identify temporal (time-based) and geographical patterns in crime incidents. The objective is to uncover peak crime hours, seasonal trends, and spatial hotspots using exploratory data analysis.

##Dataset
- Source: Chicago Crime Dataset (Kaggle)
- Description: Records of reported crime incidents in Chicago
- Key features used: Date, Primary Type, Latitude, Longitude

##Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Parsed mixed date-time formats using Python (pandas)
- Handled missing and invalid values
- Extracted temporal features such as Hour and Month
- Created an analysis-ready cleaned dataset

##Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed crime frequency by hour of day
- Identified seasonal patterns across months
- Visualized geographic distribution of crimes
- Generated interactive crime hotspot heatmaps using Folium

##Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Folium
- Google Colab

##Key Insights
- Crime incidents peak during evening and late-night hours
- Seasonal trends indicate higher crime frequency in specific months
- Geographic analysis reveals concentrated crime hotspots in urban areas
